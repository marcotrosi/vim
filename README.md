# vim

My MacVim setup is still in development, and very personalized to my needs and to my German 61 keys mechanical
keyboard with personal key-layout. Yes, all very personal.

The purpose of this repository is mainly being a backup, to track my changes just in case I need to get back to older
versions, and for getting my solutions on other computers I work with.

This is not meant to be for sharing, but of course feel free to check out my weird solutions and get inspired.
